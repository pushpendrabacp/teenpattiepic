<p><br /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  The Privacy Policy is designed to explain how EPIC Technologies Private
  Limited（"we", "EPIC"） deals with the User’s personal information when the
  User uses any EPIC’s game or service. We are committed to protecting User’s
  privacy. We will never sell or otherwise pass on the User’s privacy
  information to a third party without the User’s consent except when it is
  required to provide the User with the service the User is using. EPIC is
  required to use the personal data of all the Users by the applicable laws of
  the land where the games are being played by the Users.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">What We Collect</h3>
<p>
  When the User uses any EPIC’s game or service, the User is authorizing EPIC to
  access certain information of the User. The information we collect is to
  provide and improve our services and to fulfil User’s requirements. In each
  case, we will collect, store, and use the information User has provided
  according to this Privacy Policy. This includes the User’s name, profile
  picture, gender, networks, user IDs, list of friends, date of birth, email
  address, and any other information the User has set to public on the User’s
  Facebook.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  When a User uses any EPIC’s game or service through a social network account
  such as Facebook, Apple, etc. The user is authorizing us to access certain
  information from the User’s profile for that site according to the privacy
  settings established at the SNS by the User and the User’s friends such as the
  User’s name, address, phone number, etc. which the SNS could provide to us
  through the SNS Application Programming Interface ("API").
</p>
<p>
  When the User uses any EPIC’s game or service directly we may collect and
  store User information such as registration data, email address, and any other
  information that the User has provided on User’s profile.
</p>
<p>
  When the User accesses any EPIC game on a Mobile Device we may collect the
  User device and carrier information such as MAC Address, IP Address,
  geo-location, telephone number, the account information User has associated
  with their device, country or other information the Users provide.
</p>
<p>
  If the User purchases a license to use in-game virtual items directly from any
  EPIC game, we will collect the billing and financial information necessary to
  process the User’s charges, which may include the User’s postal and e-mail
  addresses. EPIC may also receive the billing and payment information that the
  User provides when a User purchase order is processed by another party, such
  as Facebook (for Facebook Credits) or Apple (for purchases on iOS devices).
  Our terms of service explain our policies and terms relevant to our charges
  and billing practices. Please note that purchases of third-party credits or
  currencies like Facebook Credits may also be subject to additional policies.
  We do not store the credit card information.
</p>
<p>
  When the User uses any EPIC game or service, we collect certain technical
  information to (i) analyze the usage of our sites and services; (ii) provide a
  more personalized experience; and (iii) manage advertising. We and service
  providers acting on our behalf, use Log Files and tracking technologies to
  collect and analyze certain types of technical information, including cookies,
  IP addresses, device type, device identifiers, browser types, browser
  language, referring and exit pages, and URLs, platform type, the number of
  clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those
  pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, game state and the date
  and time of activity on our websites or games, and other similar information.
  In some cases, we will associate this information with the User’s ID number
  for our internal use.
</p>
<p>
  We collect the following categories of your personal information and may sell
  it to third parties: identifiers, commercial information, internet or other
  electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and inferences
  drawn from these categories.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h3>
<p>
  Only EPIC has the right to the information. We will never sell or otherwise
  pass on the User’s privacy information to a third party without the User’s
  consent. We may use the information to notify the User of important
  announcements regarding our software developments, software upgrades, and
  special offers, to solicit the User’s feedback and input and to provide User
  the with application/software support. If the User does not want to receive
  any announcements from us, the User may manage notifications from the User
  app. Users can also ask to be excluded from such announcements by sending us
  an email to this effect. In addition, we may use User Information in a form
  that is not personally identifiable to help us in analyzing various aspects of
  user behaviour to improve our services.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Controlling User Personal Information.</h3>
<p>
  The user can terminate the User’s account at any time which will remove the
  User’s profile and other personal information from view. However, some
  information may be necessary for providing users with our services and
  support. In that event, we may not be able to provide the User with one or
  more of our services that the User is using.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  In EPIC social games, we do not delete past game results or records even if
  the User deletes the application from the User's phone or does not join again.
  EPIC will take reasonable steps to protect the User’s personal information
  from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or unauthorized alteration.
  By downloading any EPIC software creating an account or accessing or using the
  service User accepts and agrees to be bound by these terms of service.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">
  Exceptions to Restriction in Disclosure of Information or Account Information
</h3>
<p>
  User understands and agrees that we may be required to disclose any
  Information or Account Information by a competent legal authority or that we
  may voluntarily choose to disclose any such Information or Account Information
  under the reasonable belief that this is necessary for any lawful purpose. We
  will be under no legal obligation to either inform the User about the presence
  of such request or contest such a request for Information or Account
  Information whatsoever.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The User understands and accepts that downloading the game ofEPIC is the
  action of the User on his/her own consent, and they shall assume
  responsibility for system damage, data loss and any other risks. EPIC and its
  affiliates assume no responsibility for any direct, indirect, incidental,
  special and consequential damages and risks arising from using or failing to
  use EPIC’s game under any circumstances.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">GRANT OF A LICENSE TO USE THE SERVICE</h3>
<p>
  Subject to the User’s compliance with terms of service, EPIC grants Users a
  revocable, non-exclusive limited license to access and use the services. This
  license is non-transferable. User agrees to use the service for User's own
  non-commercial purposes. Users play some EPIC social games to win chips. Users
  do not play with real money. The chips the User loses or wins have no value in
  real money. At times Users may “earn” or “buy or purchase” virtual in-game
  items. These virtual items do not refer to any credit balance of real currency
  or its equivalent. EPIC reserves the right to terminate the license of any
  user without giving any reason. If EPIC believes that a user has acquired
  chips from unauthorized sources and from sources that violate the terms of the
  service, it has the right to take away all or a part of the total chips from
  the user.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  The Users agree and acknowledge that the right, title and interest over the
  intellectual property rights of the game and related software shall be solely
  owned by EPIC. If the User is involved with any infringement act, EPIC has the
  right to terminate the services of the User and take appropriate actions under
  the applicable laws for infringement of such intellectual property rights of
  EPIC.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  Downloading the game by EPIC is free. EPIC gives Users free chips to begin
  with and regularly. This gives users limited licenses to play our games. If
  the User does not lose all User's free chips, the User can play games for an
  unlimited period. If the User loses User-free chips, the User can not play any
  more. However, Users have the option to buy chips and join the game. Remember
  that the chips Users buy and win have no value in the real currency. These
  chips are not transferable and we do not offer refunds.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  By accepting to use the application, the User fully understands and agrees
  that the User can lose chips for many reasons besides losing the game. Some of
  the reasons are the client’s data connection, Internet connection, improper
  behaviour of the client, EPIC server problem, a sudden increase in traffic,
  someone else using a User account or User account being hacked and many more.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  EPIC is not liable for any loss of chips due to functioning as well as
  malfunctioning of its servers and software. Winning or not chiefly depends
  upon the random cards the User gets. When Users download issued games by EPIC,
  Users accept and agree to play them only for fun and entertainment and EPIC is
  not liable for any damage or loss whatsoever.
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">RULES AND RESTRICTIONS</h3>
<p>
  Failure to follow restrictions or terms of service can get the User account
  suspended, hacked or permanently banned. Please read the following
  restrictions that apply to the use of the service:
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>
  We recommend that minors over the age of 13 and below the age of 18 should ask
  their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves
  to anyone over the Internet. Users must not use the service if User is under
  the age of 13. The user must deny anyone under 13 to use the User account.

  but not limited to the use of credit cards or any payment by any method.
