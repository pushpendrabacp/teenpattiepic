    <title>Data Delation Policy - Teen Patti Epic</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        1. Purpose
      </p>
      <p>
        This document sets out our policy for responding to requests for deletion of data under the GDPR (General Data
        Protection Regulation), which comes into force in May 2018. This document explains the rights of the data subject
        regarding data deletion and the responsibilities of the Teen Patti Epic in responding to such a request.
      </p>
      <p>
  
        2. Individual Rights
      </p>
      <p>
        An individual has the right to erasure, also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. The principle underpinning this
        right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling
        reason for its continued processing.
      </p>
      <p>
  
        3. When does the right to erasure apply?
      </p>
      <p>
        As stipulated in the GDPR, individuals have a right to have personal data erased and to prevent processing in
        specific circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>
        • Where the personal data is no longer necessary about the purpose for which it was originally
        collected/processed;
      </p>
      <p>
        • When the individual withdraws consent;
      </p>
      <p>
        • When the individual objects to the processing and there is no other legal ground for the relevant processing
        activity;
      </p>
      <p>
        • When the personal data was unlawfully processed;
      </p>
      <p>
        • Where the personal data has to be erased to comply with a legal obligation.
      </p>
      <p>

        5. How can data be deleted?
      </p>
      <p>
        A system administrator (individual user acting on behalf of their organization) can delete data from their
        Interplace system whenever they wish. This data is deleted from the system immediately and cannot be recovered by
        any users or Teen Patti Epic&nbsp;employees after this point. Data that has been deleted or otherwise destroyed can
        not be recovered at any time.
      </p>
      <p>A sufficient warning is given to the account administrator before they permanently delete anything. +91 9449569868 I

      <p>
  
        Data Deletion Policy Data may still remain in the system's backup files, which will be deleted periodically.
        Information may be deleted from our system upon request to service@teenpatti-epic.org. We undertake to perform the
        deletion within one month (30 calendar days) and will send you a confirmation once the information has been
        deleted. Wherever possible, we will aim to complete the request in advance of the deadline.
